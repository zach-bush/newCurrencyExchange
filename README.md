Have you ever wanted to know how much your money would be worth in another country? I know when I was 19 and living in West Africa I was always having
to do the conversion in my head and it was such a pain. I would go to the ATM and withdraw the local currency while at the same time having to track
how many dollars were left in my account. What a pain that was, but it led me to create this program. This currency converter program allows you to enter in
any amount of money in US Dollars and it will convert it to 9 different countries used all over the world. You won't have to worry anymore about doing
that conversion in your head!

# Future Work


- I want to have it pull the exchange rates from a source that is always updating them. This would greatly increase the reliability of the program.
